Hey there — I'm Sean Hoar, a senior individual contributor engineer who thrives on deep technical execution. I specialize in building systems that are as dependable as they are maintainable, with my most productive work happening when I can dedicate 70%+ of my time to hands-on problem-solving. My toolkit centers on Python, React, Docker, and Kubernetes, and my process is powered by spec-driven development and AI-assisted workflows that keep me focused on technical depth rather than coordination overhead.

I'm most effective when tackling complex technical challenges independently — whether that's architecting microservices, optimizing system performance, or migrating legacy platforms. I prefer roles where success is measured by technical impact and code quality, not by scope of influence or people leadership. When I'm not building production systems, you'll find me experimenting with side projects, contributing to developer communities, or refining my development environment to eliminate friction and maximize flow state.
