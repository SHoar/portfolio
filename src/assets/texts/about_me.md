I'm Sean Hoar, a software engineer obsessed with technical depth and solving complex systems challenges. I thrive when architecting scalable solutions, optimizing performance at scale, and building infrastructure that other engineers can rely on. My expertise spans the full stack—from distributed systems and cloud architecture to sophisticated frontend systems—with the philosophy that great engineering comes from understanding every layer.

I'm most productive hands-on, diving deep into technical problems, making informed architectural decisions, and building solutions end-to-end. Whether it's containerized microservices, state management complexity, or CI/CD automation, I enjoy the intellectual challenge of solving problems that matter. I work with Python, React, Kubernetes, and modern DevOps tooling, alongside AI-augmented development to accelerate architectural clarity and implementation velocity.

Outside of code, you'll find me at developer meetups, working on side projects that scratch architectural itches, or optimizing my development environment. I believe great software emerges from curiosity, meticulous craftsmanship, and yes—containers that start reliably on the first try.
