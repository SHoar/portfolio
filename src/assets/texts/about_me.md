Hey there — I’m Sean Hoar, a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building systems that are as dependable as they are maintainable. My toolkit these days leans on Python, React, Docker, and Kubernetes, and my process is powered by a healthy dose of Agentic AI and spec-driven development. I use AI tools not just to accelerate coding, but to clarify intent, improve architecture, and keep my focus where it belongs — on solving real problems. Good systems, after all, start with good conversations between humans and their machines.

When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me fueling developer meetups, experimenting with side projects, or insisting that my Mac setup is absolutely mission-critical. I believe great software comes from curiosity, craftsmanship, and a sense of humor — preferably all running in containers that actually start on the first try.
